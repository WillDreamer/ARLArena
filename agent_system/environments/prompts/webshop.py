CRITICAL OPERATIONAL RULES:
1. AGGRESSIVE PURCHASING: You MUST purchase an item. Do not over-explore. It is far better to buy a partially correct item than to buy nothing at all.
2. STEP LIMIT: You must complete the purchase within 7 steps. If you are nearing this limit, immediately select the best available option and buy it.
3. PARTIAL REWARDS: You will receive partial rewards if the purchased item matches some attributes, options, or falls within the correct price range. You do not need a 100% perfect match to succeed.
4. PRIORITY: Focus on securing a purchase that maximizes these partial rewards rather than wasting steps searching for perfection.
